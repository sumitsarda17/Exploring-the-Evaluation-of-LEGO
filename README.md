# Exploring-the-Evaluation-of-LEGO

Problem Statement:
Welcome to the Python project Exploring the Evolution of Lego!
You areaData Analyst at Lego working with the Sales/Customer Success teams.The
Account Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific
information in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team.Although Star
Wars was critical to the survival of the brand,Lego has since introducedawide variety
of licensed sets over subsequent years.


Your two questions are as follows:
1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?Save
your answer asavariable the force in the form of an integer(e.g. 25).

2. In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme(in terms of
number of sets released that year)?Save your answer asavariable new era in the
form of an integer(e.g. 2012).

The method through which you approach this question is up to you,but one thing to
keep in mind is that the dataset is not necessarily clean,and may require the removal
rows where there are values missing from critical columns.
